# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Using C++: Comprehensive Notes


```
Lecture 01: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Using C++

Definition: 
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods.

Key Concepts:
➡️ Class: Blueprint for creating objects.
➡️ Object: Instance of a class.
➡️ Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class.
➡️ Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.
➡️ Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones.
➡️ Polymorphism: Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.

**Lecture 02: Creating Classes and Objects**
Syntax
class ClassName {
    // Access specifiers: private, public, protected
    private:
        // Data members
    public:
        // Member functions
};
int main() {
    ClassName objectName; // Creating an object
    return 0;
}
