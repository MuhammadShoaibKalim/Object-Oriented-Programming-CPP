Lecture 01: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Using C++

Definition: 
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods.

Key Concepts:
➡️ Class: Blueprint for creating objects.
➡️ Object: Instance of a class.
➡️ Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class.
➡️ Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.
➡️ Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones.
➡️ Polymorphism: Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
